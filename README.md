# Media-Keys for KDE

These are a bunch of scripts that emulate the behavior of media keys typically found on modern keyboards.

Associate these scripts with a keyboard binding in System Settings -> Shortcuts -> Custom Shortcuts -> Edit -> New -> Global Shortcut -> Command/URL, then set the trigger to the action to the script and use your preferred key as a trigger. Note that you have to save/apply every step of the way, or parts of it won't get saved. Also note that both the action *and* the group have to be enabled for the shortcut to fire.
